# n.eko
 This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, I made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and my internet can't handle streaming and discord keeps crashing when my friend attempts to. I just want to watch anime with my friends ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) so I started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then I found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and I was able to figure out the rest. This is by no means a fully featured clone of Rabbit, it has only *one* room. It's stateless, so no saved user names or passwords. 

## Features
  * Text Chat (With basic markdown support, discord flavor)
  * Admin users (Kick, Ban & Force Give/Release Controls)
  * Clipboard synchronization (on [supported browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText))
  * Emote overlay
  * Ignore user (chat and emotes)
  * Persistent settings

## Why n.eko?
I like cats üê± (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.
